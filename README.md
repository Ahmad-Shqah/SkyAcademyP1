Goals Accomplished:

  - Joined the Web Development world.
  - Learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Became familiar with VSCode and GitHub.
This project serves as a practice exercise to build a simple website using only pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any frameworks. The primary goal is to apply and reinforce what I have learned so far in my journey. My next project will be more professional, incorporating Angular 17, Bootstrap 5, and other modern tools and technologies.
